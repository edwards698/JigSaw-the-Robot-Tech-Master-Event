# JigSaw-the-Robot-Tech-Master-Event
Our project is an AI-powered jigsaw puzzle-solving robot designed to autonomously recognize, sort, and assemble puzzle pieces into a complete picture. This system leverages a combination of advanced technologies including computer vision, machine learning, and robotics to solve puzzles with minimal human intervention.
